# IJCAI 2025 Code and Datasets - From Local to Global: Generalized Calibration Models for Low-Cost Air Quality Monitoring
## Project Overview
This repository contains the datasets, evaluation metrics, and Python source code used for analyzing the performance of machine learning models in a multi-location regression context. The structure of the repository is organized to provide easy access to the necessary files and facilitate the evaluation process.

### Directory Structure
1. dataset/
This directory contains:

Datasets: The primary datasets used for training and testing the models.
Metrics: Files with evaluation metrics computed during the analysis.

2. src/
This directory includes:

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing the Python source code for model evaluation and analysis. These notebooks provide a detailed implementation of the experiments and the results processing pipeline.
